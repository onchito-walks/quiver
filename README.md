# Quiver — Adaptive Context Optimizer for AI Agents

AI agents are born carrying every arrow they might ever need — thirty-three
of them, broadheads and field points alike, every shaft carved with every
lesson ever learned. They draw the whole quiver on every turn whether they're
aiming at anything or not. Most of those arrows never fly. They just sit
there, heavy on the string, burning attention on tools no target demands.

A hunter's quiver does not work this way. The quiver itself — the leather,
the stitching, the strap — is always on the hip. Light enough to forget it's
there. Inside: broadheads for the hunt, field points for everyday work. The
hunter reaches in and draws only the head the target demands. At night, the
fletcher empties the quiver, sharpens dull broadheads, replaces bent field
points, and checks that the leather hasn't stretched.

Quiver is that quiver. AGENTS.md and SOUL.md form the bag — always carried,
kept lean. Broadheads and field points fill it — drawn on demand. The fletcher
works nightly while the archer sleeps.

### The Quiver — AGENTS.md + SOUL.md

The leather and stitching. Always on the hip. Must be light enough to forget it's
there. Strict size budgets enforced by the fletcher every night.

| File | Before | After | What moved |
|---|---|---|---|
| AGENTS.md | 19.0 KB | 3.1 KB | Research, routing, delegation, GitHub → field points |
| SOUL.md | 10.1 KB | 3.5 KB | Removed overlaps, tightened prose |
| Combined | 29.1 KB | 6.6 KB | -77% |

### Broadheads — Heavy Tools

Inside the quiver. Disabled globally, cataloged in GBrain (`systems/tool-catalog`),
dispatched as isolated subagents. A broadhead is never drawn unless there's big game.

| Broadhead | Tools | Drawn when |
|---|---|---|
| browser | 10 | "go to this website", "take a screenshot" |
| session_search | 1 | "find that conversation" |
| code_execution | 1 | "run this analysis" |
| image_gen | 1 | "generate an image" |
| video_gen | 1 | "make a video" |
| tts | 1 | "read this aloud" |
| x_search | 1 | "search twitter" |
| vision | 1 | "analyze this image" |
| video | 1 | "what's in this clip" |

### Field Points — Skills

Inside the quiver. Loaded on demand when the task calls for them. Never burn tokens
in sessions that don't need them.

| Field point | Drawn when |
|---|---|
| research-methodology | research, look up, study, investigate |
| search-routing | search, find |
| github-autonomy | push, repo, github |
| harness-compensation | delegation, verification, subagents |
| lazy-tools | frustration detection, tool dispatch |
| credential-isolation | credential, API key, token |
| leviathan-routing-architecture | model, provider, routing |

### The Fletcher — Nightly, 02:00 UTC

- **Sharpens broadheads**: Promotes frequently-used tools back to active.
- **Replaces field points**: Flags stale skills, overlapping triggers, dead crons.
- **Trims the leather**: Flags AGENTS.md/SOUL.md if they exceed the 8 KB budget.
- **Catalogs new heads**: Finds undiscovered tools and adds them to GBrain.
- **Updates the ledger**: Patches the lazy-tools skill, updates this README.

| `skills` | 3 | Skill management |
| `memory` | 1 | Persistence |
| `delegation` | 1 | Quiver's engine |
| `cronjob` | 1 | Scheduled work |
| `todo` | 1 | Task tracking |

### Broadheads (subagent dispatch)

| Broadhead | Tools | Subagent toolsets |
|---|---|---|
| `browser` | 10 | `["browser", "web"]` |
| `session_search` | 1 | `["session_search"]` |
| `code_execution` | 1 | `["code_execution", "terminal"]` |

| **Impact** | | | |
| System prompt | 33.3 KB | 21.6 KB | **-35%** |
| Per-turn tokens saved | — | ~12,000 | — |
| Monthly savings | — | ~120M tokens / ~$65 | — |
| "I can't do that" rate | frequent | near-zero | — |

## Design Principles

**The shaft is always there.** AGENTS.md + SOUL.md form every arrow. Keep them light.

**The head matches the target.** Broadhead for the hunt. Field point for everyday
work. Never draw a head the target doesn't demand.

**Frustration is a draw signal.** "Why can't you" means a broadhead should have been
nocked. Quiver detects this and dispatches immediately.

**The fletcher works while the archer sleeps.** Nightly analysis of real usage data.
Catalog patches. Budget enforcement. No human intervention needed.

**Semantic matching over keywords.** Arrowheads are stored with rich descriptions in
a vector database. The hunter says what they need; Quiver finds the right head by
meaning, not by memorized trigger phrases.

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Implementation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Catalog** | GBrain vector DB (pgvector) | Already deployed, zero new infra |
| **Intent matching** | GBrain semantic search | Hybrid vector + keyword + graph |
| **Frustration detection** | Skill-level pattern matching | Fast, no API call |
| **Dispatch** | Hermes `delegate_task` with `toolsets` | Native tool-restricted workers |
| **The Fletcher** | Hermes cron (LLM-driven) | Reads sessions, patches skills, updates catalog |
| **Config** | Hermes `hermes tools enable/disable` | Native, persistent |

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Sheathe the broadheads
hermes tools disable browser session_search code_execution vision \
  image_gen video_gen tts x_search video clarify homeassistant yuanbao

# 2. Filter MCP servers
# Add tools: {include: [...]} to mcp_servers.gbrain and mcp_servers.github

# 3. Install the router
cp skills/lazy-tools/SKILL.md ~/.hermes/skills/devops/lazy-tools/SKILL.md

# 4. Seed the catalog
python3 scripts/seed-catalog.py

# 5. Wake the fletcher
hermes cron create --name lazy-tools-nightly-learn --schedule "0 2 * * *" \
  --skills lazy-tools --toolsets web,terminal,file,skills,delegation \
  --prompt "$(cat crons/nightly-learn-prompt.md)"

# 6. Verify
hermes prompt-size     # shaft + light heads = ~37 KB schemas, ~22 KB prompt
hermes tools list      # 8 nocked, broadheads sheathed
```

## Limitations

MCP tool filtering requires gateway restart. Broadheads add 5-15s subagent dispatch
latency. Frustration detection is keyword-based, improved nightly. Toolset granularity
is a Hermes limitation (can't split `file` to keep read_file but drop patch).
